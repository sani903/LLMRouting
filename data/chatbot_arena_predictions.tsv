I am in a fast space traveling 0 towards a star 1 au away.  I instantly accelerate to 0.5c towards the star causing length contraction.  Is the star no closer because length has contracted or is it now further away because only the meter sticks on my ship have contracted and more of them would fit between us… or has somehow these phenomena canceled and I’m the same distance apart.	zephyr-7b-beta	mistral-7b-instruct	1	0

"can you tell me more about enlightement processes by famous religious figures just like Todd Murphy, would do?  context:""""""This talk, by neuroscientist and author Todd Murphy, explores a hypothesis about what happens in the brain when a person attains enlightenment. Using concepts in neurotheology (the brain's role in religion and mysticism) developed by Michael A. Persinger (inventor of the God Helmet). Murphy (inventor of the Shiva Neural stimulation system) explores the brain's role in enlightenment as understood in Buddhism. The talk also looks at the self (or sense of self), and how its place as a brain function allows it to be flexible enough to change as a person becomes enlightened. It examines a few case histories, including those of Ramana Maharishi, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, The Buddha, and some others. This is the third in Murphy's lectures series on neurotheology.

Three prisoners get a chance to get a free out of jail card but they have to play a game.  They see 5 hats, 2 white ones and 3 black ones. Each prisoner gets told that they get one of the 5 hats but can't see their own hat They are placed in such a way that each prisoner can see the hat of the other two, but not their own.  They are not allowed to communicate or give signs.  The guards give them the 3 black hats. If a prisoner says the wrong color, they all stay in jail. After half an hour all 3 say, they have a black hat.  How did they know? I think you misunderstood. Each prisoner had a black hat on their head, and could only see the hat of the other two prisoners. This means each prisoner saw 2 black hats. They were not allowed to talk, how could they all 3 come to the conclusion that they had a black hat and not a white hat? This is a riddle. Wrong, they are not allowed to communicate, if they were caught sending signals by being surprised they would loose. here is a hint. Again the prisoners know there are 3 black hats and 2 white hats in play. To understand how they understood after half an hour that they all had black hats you should look at the situation if not 3 black hats were choosen by the guards but instead 2 white hats and a black hat. Explain this strategy in more detail especially how it works without communicating Would you say this strategy was based a bit on luck? But how does the individual prisoner come to the conclusion that he has a black hat and not a white hat? He sees 2 of the 3 black hats and knows that he can have either the one left over black hat or one of the 2 white hats. So how can he be sure after 30 minutes that he has a black hat? To be clear, and this is important for the solution (which I have not yet heard) they can say which hat they have at any point in time. It is only that it took 30 minutes before the first said what hat he has, then the other two followed with the same conclusion Ok, I still did not get the correct solution how the first prisoner knew that he didn't have a white hat. Do you want to give it another try? Or should I solve it? Wrong again. Here the solution. If 2 white hats were in play (maximum of white hats) one prisoner would immediately know, that he must have a black hat and immediately say so. So this possibility can be quickly eliminated. Question is, why do they also know, after 30 minutes, that not a single white hat is in play? No, if two white hats were in play, one prisoner, seeing them would have spoken up immediately as he would be certain that he must have a black hat, as there are only 2 white hats. This did not happen.  So the prisoners knew quickly that not 2 white hats are in play. So either one or none.  If one white hat was in play, two ppl would have seen this white hat, and since noone said anything for a while (seeing two white hats) they would know that they must have a black hat. As they saw the only possible white hat.  But since for 30 minutes noone stepped up to say so, they all were certain that only the last combination was possible, all black hats	wizardlm-13b	oasst-pythia-12b	0	0

Imagine a cozy indoor setting, with a young woman seated on a plush couch, bathed in the warm, colorful glow of string lights and neon signs visible through a rain-speckled window. She's dressed in a casual, off-shoulder top and shorts, her posture relaxed and inviting. Instead of a book, she's lovingly cradling a photorealistic high resolution contented cat in her lap, the feline's fur catching the kaleidoscope of lights from the room. The ambiance is one of serene intimacy, the room filled with shelves of books and personal trinkets that give it a lived-in feel. The artwork should have a vibrant, almost otherworldly quality, with rich colors and a slightly surreal, dreamlike overlay.	llama-2-7b-chat	stripedhyena-nous-7b	0	0
