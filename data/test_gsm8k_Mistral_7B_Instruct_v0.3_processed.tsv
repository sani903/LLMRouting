40000	Answer: First, we need to find the new value of the house after repairs. The original value of the house was $80,000 and it increased by 150%, so the new value is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000. The profit Josh made is the difference between the selling price of the house and the total cost he paid, which is $92,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $<<92000-80000-50000=40000>>40,000. #### 40000	Answer: First, we need to find the new value of the house after repairs.~| The original value of the house was $80,000 and it increased by 150%, so the new value is $80,000 * 1.15 = $<<80000*1.15=92000>>92,000.~| The profit Josh made is the difference between the selling price of the house and the total cost he paid, which is $92,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $<<92000-80000-50000=40000>>40,000.~| #### 40000

Unknown	Answer:  1. First, we need to determine how many full-priced glasses Kylar will buy. Since he wants to buy 16 glasses, we can divide the total number of glasses by 2 (since every second glass costs 60% of the price) to find out how many full-priced glasses he will buy: 16 / 2 = 8 2. Next, we need to find out how many discounted glasses he will buy. Since he wants to buy 16 glasses and he has already bought 8 full-priced glasses, he will buy the remaining 16 - 8 = 8 discounted glasses. 3. Now, we can calculate the cost of the full-priced glasses: 8 glasses * $5 = $<<8*5=40>>40 4. We can calculate the cost of the discounted glasses: 8 glasses * 0.6 * $5 = 8 * 0.6 * $5 = $<<8*0.6*5=24>>24 5.

60	Answer: First, we need to find out how much of the file Carla downloaded before the restart. Since 40% of the file was downloaded before the restart, that means 60% of the file was not downloaded.  So, the amount of the file that was not downloaded is 200 GB * (1 - 0.6) = 200 GB * 0.4 = 80 GB  Now, we need to find out how much time it took to download the 80 GB. Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, it takes 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes to download 80 GB.  Since it took 20 minutes for the restart, the total time it takes to download the file is 40 minutes (to download the 80 GB) + 20 minutes (for the restart) = 60 minutes  #### 60	Answer: First, we need to find out how much of the file Carla downloaded before the restart.

Unknown	Answer: Henry traveled 35 miles between his first and second stops.  Here's the reasoning:  1. The total distance of the bike trip is 60 miles. 2. Henry stopped after 20 miles, so he traveled 40 miles (60 - 20) before his second stop. 3. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, so there are 45 miles left after his second stop (60 - 15). 4. Therefore, the distance between the two stops is the difference between the distances he traveled before the second stop and the distance left after the second stop, which is 40 - 45 = -5. 5. Since the distance cannot be negative, we know that Henry must have traveled the opposite direction between the two stops, which means he traveled 5 miles more than the distance between the two stops. 6. Thus, the distance between the two stops is 5 - (-5) = 10 miles, but since he traveled in the opposite direction, the actual distance is 10 * -1 = -10. 7.

Unknown	Answer: Let's denote the cost of the boots as B. The cost of the two pairs of high heels is 5 dollars less than the cost of the boots, so we can write the equation: B - (33 + 2*x) = 5, where x is the cost of one pair of high heels. Since one pair of high heels costs twice as much as the other, we can write x = 2y, where y is the cost of the first pair of high heels. Substituting x in the original equation, we get B - (33 + 2\*(2y)) = 5, which simplifies to B - 66 + 4y = 5. Solving for B, we get B = 66 - 4y + 5, which can be rewritten as B = 61 - 4y. Since the cost of the boots must be an integer, we can write the equation 61 - 4y = n, where n is an integer.

70	Answer: Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G. We know that G = S + 30. We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110. Now we have a system of two equations: 1. G = S + 30 2. S + G = 110 We can solve this system by substitution. First, let's solve equation 1 for S: S = G - 30. Now, substitute this expression for S in equation 2: (G - 30) + G = 110. Combining the terms on the left side gives 2G - 30 = 110. Adding 30 to both sides gives 2G = 140. Finally, dividing both sides by 2 gives G = 70. #### 70	Answer: Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.~| We know that G = S + 30.~| We also know that the total number of coins is 110, so S + G = 110.~| Now we have a system of two equations:~| 1.

440	Answer: John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, so he buys 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so they cost 1.5 times the cost of blue ties. Since blue ties cost $40 each, red ties cost 1.5*$40=$<<1.5*40=60>>60 each. Since he bought 4 red ties, he spent 4*$60=$<<4*60=240>>240 on red ties.

8	To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to determine the weight of the truck and driver when empty.  The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, so the weight of the empty truck is 3755 - 15 (the weight of one box) = 3740 pounds.  The weight of the truck with the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is the weight limit of the bridge minus the weight of the empty truck.  So, the weight of the truck with the maximum number of boxes is 5000 - 3740 = 1260 pounds.  Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the weight of the truck with the maximum number of boxes by the weight of one box to find the maximum number of boxes.  1260 / 15 = 84  Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 84.  #### 8	To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to determine the weight of the truck and driver when empty.~| ~| The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds, so the weight of the empty truck is 3755 - 15 (the weight of one box) = 3740 pounds.~| ~| The weight of the truck with the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded is the weight limit of the bridge minus the weight of the empty truck.~| ~| So, the weight of the truck with the maximum number of boxes is 5000 - 3740 = 1260 pounds.~| ~| Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the weight of the truck with the maximum number of boxes by the weight of one box to find the maximum number of boxes.~| ~| 1260 / 15 = 84~| ~| Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 84.~| ~| #### 8

72	Let's denote the number of dogs as D and the number of cats as C. We know that D + C = 60 + 12 (since there are 12 fewer rabbits than the combined number of dogs and cats).  Since there are two cats for every dog, we can write the number of cats as 2D. Substituting this into our first equation, we get:  D + 2D = 60 + 12 3D = 72  Dividing both sides by 3, we find that the number of dogs is 72/3 = <<72/3=24>>24.  Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats is 2 * 24 = <<2*24=48>>48.  The total number of pets in the neighborhood is the number of dogs plus the number of cats, which is 24 + 48 = <<24+48=72>>72.  #### 72	Let's denote the number of dogs as D and the number of cats as C.

Unknown	To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:  1. Brittany's phone can hold 50 times fewer photographs than Jamal's phone. So, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 1800 / 50 = <<1800/50=36>>36. 2. Since the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph, the number of birds in the photograph is 36 / 50 = <<36/50=0.72>>0.72. 3. Since the number of birds in the photograph is a fraction, it cannot be a number of ducks. Instead, we can find the nearest whole number less than or equal to 0.72, which is 1.  Therefore, there are ####1 duck in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.	To solve this problem, we can break it down into steps:~| ~| 1.

To do that, we divide the total distance she wants to run (7 hours) by the speed she runs at after the first 3 hours (5 miles per hour): 7/5=1.4 hours. 4. Since she runs for 1.4 hours at 5 miles per hour, she runs 5*1.4=<<5*1.4=7>>7 miles during that time. 5. Adding the miles she ran during the first 3 hours to the miles she ran during the last 1.4 hours, we get 30+7=<<30+7=37>>37 miles.  #### 37	Answer:~| ~| 1.

10	Answer: Let's denote the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as A. The number of letters needing stamps is 60. Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 letters. Now there are 60 - 20 = <<60-20=40>>40 letters needing stamps. The number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is now A + 20. We know that A + 30 = 40, so A = 40 - 30 = <<40-30=10>>10. #### 10	Answer: Let's denote the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters as A.~| The number of letters needing stamps is 60.~| Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, which is 60/3 = <<60/3=20>>20 letters.~| Now there are 60 - 20 = <<60-20=40>>40 letters needing stamps.~| The number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters is now A + 20.~| We know that A + 30 = 40, so A = 40 - 30 = <<40-30=10>>10.~| #### 10
10	Julia started with 0 spoons. She bought a package of spoons that gave her an additional amount. Let's call this amount x. Her husband gave her 5 more spoons, so she now has x + 5 spoons. She used 3 spoons to sample her stew, so she now has x + 5 - 3 = x + 2 spoons. When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons, so x + 2 = 12. Solving for x, we find x = 12 - 2 = <<12-2=10>>10. So Julia bought a package of 10 spoons. #### 10	Julia started with 0 spoons.~| She bought a package of spoons that gave her an additional amount.

880	Answer: First, we find the cost of one pepper: 15$. Next, we find the cost of a watermelon: 3 * 15 = <<3*15=45>>45$. The cost of an orange is 5 less than the cost of a watermelon, so it costs 45 - 5 = <<45-5=40>>40$. Now, we calculate the total cost of the watermelons: 4 * 45 = <<4*45=180>>180$. The total cost of the peppers is 20 * 15 = <<20*15=300>>300$. Finally, we calculate the total cost of the oranges: 10 * 40 = <<10*40=400>>400$.

21	Answer:  1. First, let's find the price increase per two months. A 20% increase means multiplying the original price by 1.2 (1 + 0.2). 2. Since there are 6 two-month periods in a year, the price increase per year is 6 * 20% = 120%. 3. After 36 months, the price increase is 36 * 120% = 4320%. 4. To find the new price, we multiply the original price by the increase: $20 * 4320% = $20 * (1 + 4320%) = $20 * (1 + 0.00432) = $20.864 (rounded to four decimal places). 5. However, since we need to give the answer as an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number: $21.  #### 21	Answer:~| ~| 1. First, let's find the price increase per two months.

16	Answer: In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. Let's call Brooke's current age x. Then, Seth's current age is 2x. In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x+2 and Seth's age will be 2x+2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be x+2 + 2x+2 = 3x+4. We know that the sum of their ages in 2 years is 28, so we can set up the equation: 3x+4 = 28. To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24. Finally, we can divide both sides by 3: x = 24/3 = <<24/3=8>>8.

Unknown	Answer: First, let's find the cost of the hat. We know that the pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the jacket costs more than the pants.  Let's denote the cost of the hat as x. Then, the cost of the jacket is 3x. The cost of the pants is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket, so the pants cost (x + 3x) / 2 = 2x / 2 = x.  Now, we know that the total cost of the uniform is the cost of the hat + the cost of the jacket + the cost of the pants. So, the total cost of the uniform is x + 3x + x = 4x.  Since we don't have a specific value for x, we can't write the exact total cost of each uniform as an integer. However, we can say that the total cost of each uniform is 4 times the cost of the hat, which is an integer multiple of 25.  #### No integer answer provided.

95	Answer: First, let's find out how long it takes Billy to peel a potato: 1 minute 30 seconds = 90 seconds. Next, let's find out how long it takes Billy to cut up a potato: 5 seconds. Now, let's find out how long it takes Billy to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds. Since it takes Billy the same amount of time to peel and cut each potato, we can find out how long it takes him to peel and cut all 60 potatoes by multiplying the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by the number of potatoes: 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds. Finally, let's convert this time to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes. #### 95	Answer: First, let's find out how long it takes Billy to peel a potato: 1 minute 30 seconds = 90 seconds.~| Next, let's find out how long it takes Billy to cut up a potato: 5 seconds.~| Now, let's find out how long it takes Billy to peel and cut one potato: 90 seconds (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting) = 95 seconds.~| Since it takes Billy the same amount of time to peel and cut each potato, we can find out how long it takes him to peel and cut all 60 potatoes by multiplying the time it takes to peel and cut one potato by the number of potatoes: 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.~| Finally, let's convert this time to minutes: 5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes.~| #### 95
Unknown	Answer:  1. First, let's find out how many gallons they made. To do this, we need to divide the profit by the profit per gallon. The profit per gallon is the profit per glass times the number of glasses per gallon. So, profit per gallon = $0.50 * 20 = $<<0.50*20=10>>10. Now, we can find out how many gallons they made by dividing the profit by the profit per gallon: $25 / $10 = 2.5 gallons. Since they can't make half a gallon, we'll round up to 3 gallons.  2. Next, let's find out how much they spent on lemons for these 3 gallons. The cost of lemons per gallon is $3. So, the cost of lemons for 3 gallons is $3 * 3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.  3.

42	Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 4/6 or 2/3. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is less likely than rolling a number greater than 3 by a factor of 2/3 - 1/4 = (2/3 - 1/4) * 12 = (8/12 - 3/12) * 12 = 5/12. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 5/12 * 100 = 41.67%. However, since we are looking for an integer answer, we round the percentage to the nearest whole number: 41.67% ≈ 42%. #### 42	Answer: The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 4/6 or 2/3.~| The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is (1/2)*(1/2) = 1/4.~| The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is less likely than rolling a number greater than 3 by a factor of 2/3 - 1/4 = (2/3 - 1/4) * 12 = (8/12 - 3/12) * 12 = 5/12.~| To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 5/12 * 100 = 41.67%.~| However, since we are looking for an integer answer, we round the percentage to the nearest whole number: 41.67% ≈ 42%.~| #### 42

4	Answer: Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.  We know that the total number of chickens is R + W, and that W = R + 2.  We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, which means that the number of eggs produced by the red chickens plus the number of eggs produced by the white chickens is equal to 42.  So we can write the following equations:  1. R + W = Total number of chickens 2. 3R + 5W = Total number of eggs  We can substitute W = R + 2 from equation 1 into equation 2 to get:  3R + 5(R + 2) = 42  Solving this equation for R, we get:  3R + 5R + 10 = 42 8R = 32 R = 4  So Jerry has 4 red chickens.  #### 4	Answer: Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.~| ~| We know that the total number of chickens is R + W, and that W = R + 2.~| ~| We also know that the total number of eggs collected is 42, which means that the number of eggs produced by the red chickens plus the number of eggs produced by the white chickens is equal to 42.~| ~| So we can write the following equations:~| ~| 1.

Unknown	Answer: Let's denote the number of bananas that Jamal has as x. Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Andrea has x+4 apples. Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has x/2 bananas. Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal has x-4 apples. We know that Andrea has 52 apples, so x+4 = 52.

Unknown	Answer: There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is 2 times the number of players on the defense. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is 1/2 the number of players on the defense. Since the total number of players is 105, we can set up the following equation: Offense + Defense + Special Teams = 105  We know that the number of players on the offense is 2 times the number of players on the defense, and the number of players on the special teams is 1/2 the number of players on the defense. So we can rewrite the equation as: 2 Defense + Defense + 1/2 Defense = 105  Combining the terms gives us: 3.5 Defense = 105  Since we cannot have half a player, we must round up to the nearest whole number. So the number of players on the defense is 105 / 3.5 = <<105/3	Answer: There are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the offense is 2 times the number of players on the defense.~| There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, so the number of players on the special teams is 1/2 the number of players on the defense.~| Since the total number of players is 105, we can set up the following equation:~| Offense + Defense + Special Teams = 105~| ~| We know that the number of players on the offense is 2 times the number of players on the defense, and the number of players on the special teams is 1/2 the number of players on the defense.~| So we can rewrite the equation as:~| 2 Defense + Defense + 1/2 Defense = 105~| ~| Combining the terms gives us:~| 3.5 Defense = 105~| ~| Since we cannot have half a player, we must round up to the nearest whole number.

14	Answer: Let's call the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal x. At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5. At the second bus stop, 7 people got down, so the total number of people on the bus is x + 5 - 7 = x - 2. 8 more people got in at the second bus stop, so the total number of people on the bus is x - 2 + 8 = x + 6.

320	Answer: 1. First, we need to find the cost of the materials for the DIY wallpaper. To do this, we subtract 20% of the market price from the market price. 2. To subtract 20%, we multiply the market price by 0.8 (since 1 - 0.2 = 0.8). 3. So, the cost of the materials for the DIY wallpaper is 400 * 0.8 = 320. 4. Since the DIY wallpaper is free after considering the materials cost, the total cost is the cost of the materials, which is 320. #### 320	Answer:~| 1.

16384	Answer: First, we need to find the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number were faulty, we can calculate this as 40/100 * 400000 = 160000. Now, we need to find the number of functioning pieces of equipment. Since there are 400000 - 160000 = <<400000-160000=240000>>240000 pieces of equipment in total, the number of functioning pieces of equipment is 400000 - 160000 = 240000. Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment by multiplying the number of functioning pieces of equipment by the price per piece of equipment, which is $400000 / 240000 = <<400000/240000=16384>>16384. #### 16384	Answer:~| First, we need to find the number of faulty pieces of equipment.

Unknown	Answer:  1. Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, so he uses 8 * 900 = 7200 watts of energy per day. 2. If he reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, he uses 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day. 3. With the reduced time, he uses 3 * 900 = 2700 watts of energy per day. 4. The difference in energy usage is 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts per day. 5. To find out the energy usage in 30 days, we multiply the daily difference by the number of days: 4500 * 30 = 135,000 watts. 6. Since 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts, we divide the total energy usage by 1000 to get the energy usage in kilowatts: 135,000 / 1000 = 135 kilowatts	Answer:~| ~| 1.

Unknown	Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as A.  The number of apples Joanne gathered from the tallest trees is 30, and her sister gathered twice as many, so her sister gathered 30*2 = 60 apples from the tallest trees.  The number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees is half of that, so she gathered 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 3 times as many, so she gathered 15*3 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.  The total number of apples the sisters gathered is 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + A (average) = 500.  So we can write the equation: 30 + 15 + A = 500.  Solving for A, we get A = 500 - 30 - 15 = 485 - 30 - 15 = 460.

Unknown	Answer: Let's denote the number of letters in Indras' name as x. Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, we can write the number of letters in her sister's name as x + 4 + 2x/2 = x + 2x/2 + 4 = 3x/2 + 4. The total number of letters in both names is x + (3x/2 + 4) = 5x/2 + 4. Since both numbers are integers, we can set up the following equation: 5x/2 + 4 = integer Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 5x + 8 = even Since the left side of the equation is odd, the right side must be even, which means it must be a multiple of 2. The smallest possible value for 5x + 8 that is a multiple of 2 is 10, which occurs when x = 2.

Unknown	Answer: First, we calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The set of pot and pans costs $120.00, the set of mixing bowls costs $20.00, and 5 utensils cost 5*$5.00 = $<<5*5=25>>25. The total cost before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $<<120+20+25=165>>165.  Now, we calculate the discount. A 20% discount means the total cost is reduced by 20% of the original cost. The discount is 0.20 * $165.00 = $<<0.20*165=33>>33.  Finally, we subtract the discount from the original cost to find the final cost. The final cost is $165.00 - $33.00 = $<<165-33=132>>132.

98	Answer: First, we need to find the width of the room in feet. We know that the area of the rectangle is 360 square feet and the length is 3 yards. Since there are 3 feet in a yard, the length is actually 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 feet.  We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is Area = Length * Width. Solving for the width, we get Width = Area / Length = 360 / 9 = <<360/9=40>>40 feet.  Now, we can find the perimeter of the room using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width) = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = <<2*(9+40)=98>>98 feet.  #### 98	Answer: First, we need to find the width of the room in feet.

To do this, we divide the total cost of the razors after the discount by the total number of razors. 4. The total cost of the razors after the discount is the total cost of the 2 packs minus the discount. Since each pack costs $4.00, the total cost of the 2 packs is 2*$4.00 = $<<2*4=8>>8. 5.

Unknown	Answer:  1. First, we need to find out how many days there are between December 31st and July 19th. 2. To do this, we can use the formula: (month - 1) + (day - 1) / number of days in the month + number of months 3. In this case, we have: (7 - 1) + (19 - 1) / 31 + 6 = 6 + 19/31 + 6 = 6 + 0.59 + 6 = 12.59 4. Since Andy can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13 days. 5. Now, we can calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs. by multiplying the number of pounds by the number of calories per pound: 30 * 3500 = 105,000 calories 6.

3	Answer: First, let's find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant with 36 red tulips. 36 red tulips can be divided by 6 (the number of red tulips in a row) with a remainder of 0, which means he can plant 36/6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows of red tulips. Next, let's find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant with 24 blue tulips. 24 blue tulips can be divided by 8 (the number of blue tulips in a row) with a remainder of 0, which means he can plant 24/8 = <<24/8=3>>3 rows of blue tulips. Since Jackson is planting rows of flowers one after the other, he will plant the fewest number of rows of flowers, which is the smaller number of rows between red and blue tulips. In this case, it's 3 rows of blue tulips. #### 3	Answer: First, let's find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant with 36 red tulips.~| 36 red tulips can be divided by 6 (the number of red tulips in a row) with a remainder of 0, which means he can plant 36/6 = <<36/6=6>>6 rows of red tulips.~| Next, let's find out how many rows of blue tulips Jackson can plant with 24 blue tulips.~| 24 blue tulips can be divided by 8 (the number of blue tulips in a row) with a remainder of 0, which means he can plant 24/8 = <<24/8=3>>3 rows of blue tulips.~| Since Jackson is planting rows of flowers one after the other, he will plant the fewest number of rows of flowers, which is the smaller number of rows between red and blue tulips.

Unknown	Answer:  1. First, we need to find out how many cups of raisins are left for granola and snack mix after making oatmeal cookies. 2. To make one batch of oatmeal cookies, Heather needs 3/4 of a cup of raisins. So, for all the raisins in the bag, she can make 27 / (3/4) = 33.75 batches of oatmeal cookies. 3. Since it's not possible to make a fraction of a batch, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 33 batches of oatmeal cookies. 4. After making 33 batches of oatmeal cookies, there will be 27 - (33 * 3/4) = 27 - 24.75 = 2.25 cups of raisins left for granola and snack mix. 5. Since it's not possible to make a fraction of a batch with the remaining raisins, Heather cannot make any more batches of oatmeal cookies. 6. Therefore,	Answer:~| ~| 1.

Unknown	Answer: 1. The total number of seats is 4 rows * 18 seats per row = 72 seats. 2. One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so 72 seats - (1/4) * 72 seats = 72 - 18 = 54 seats are left for the parents and students. 3. One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so (54 - (1/3) * 54) seats are left for the students. 4.

10	Answer: Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x (in inches).  Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equal to 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.  The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, so we have the equation: 100 = 9x + 10.  To solve for x, we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 90 = 9x.  Then, we divide both sides by 9: x = 10.  So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.  #### 10	Answer: Let's denote the length of one of Bobby's shoes as x (in inches).~| ~| Topher's shoe is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equal to 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches.~| ~| The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, so we have the equation: 100 = 9x + 10.~| ~| To solve for x, we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 90 = 9x.~| ~| Then, we divide both sides by 9: x = 10.~| ~| So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.~| ~| #### 10

Since 90 people were required to split into groups, we can divide 90 by 9 (the number of people in each group) to find the number of groups: 90 / 9 = <<90/9=10>>10 groups. 2. Next, we need to find the number of groups that each brought back 2 seashells. Since 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells, we can multiply the total number of groups by 3/5 to find the number of groups that brought back 2 seashells: 10 * (3/5) = (30 / 5) = 6 groups. 3. Finally, we can multiply the number of groups that brought back 2 seashells by the number of seashells each group brought back to find the total number of seashells brought: 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 seashells.  #### 12	Answer:~| ~| 1.

Unknown	Answer: Let's call the amount of salt, sugar, citrus zest, fragrance, and oil as S, T, Z, F, and O respectively.  We know that S = T, and O = 2S and O = 2Z.  Since S = T, we can substitute T for S in the equation O = 2S, which gives us O = 2(S).  We also know that O = 2Z, so we can substitute O with 2S from the previous equation, which gives us 2S = 2Z.  Since S = T, we can substitute S for T in the equation Z = S, which gives us Z = T.  Now we have three equations:  1. S = T 2. O = 2S 3. Z = T  We can substitute S for T in the equation O = 2S, which gives us O = 2(T).  Since the scrub fills a 10-ounce jar, we can write the equation S + T + Z + F + O = 10.

Unknown	Answer: Since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, and Paul is 10 years older than John, we can write the equation: Peter = Paul + John. Since the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100, we can write the equation: Peter + Paul + Jean = 100. Since Paul is 10 years older than John, we can write the equation: Paul = John + 10. Now we have three equations with three variables: Peter = Paul + John Peter + Paul + Jean = 100 Paul = John + 10 We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get: Peter = (John + 10) + John. We can then substitute the third equation into this equation to get: Peter = 2*John + 10. Since we don't have enough information to find the exact age of John, we can't find the exact age of Peter.

179	Answer: First, we need to find the labor cost. Since the job took 2.25 hours, the labor cost is 2.25 * $35 = $<<2.25*35=79.50>>79.50 (but we cannot have a decimal amount for the charge, so we'll round to the nearest whole dollar).

Together they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we have the equation: A + 4A + 5 + (339 - A - 4A - 5) = 339 Simplifying the equation gives us: 5A = 333 Dividing both sides by 5 gives us A = 66.6 Since the number of Pokemon caught must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us A = 67. Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 67 Pokemon, we can find the number of Pokemon Stan has caught by subtracting the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught from the total number of Pokemon Stan and Adelwolfe have caught together: 339	Answer: Let's denote the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught as A.~| Stan has caught 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so Stan has caught 4A Pokemon.~| Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4A+5) Pokemon.~| Together they have caught 339 Pokemon, so we have the equation: A + 4A + 5 + (339 - A - 4A - 5) = 339~| Simplifying the equation gives us: 5A = 333~| Dividing both sides by 5 gives us A = 66.6~| Since the number of Pokemon caught must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number, giving us A = 67.~| Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 67 Pokemon, we can find the number of Pokemon Stan has caught by subtracting the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught from the total number of Pokemon Stan and Adelwolfe have caught together: 339

17	Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To peel 90 shrimp, she needs 90 / 6 = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes.  After peeling the shrimp, she sautes them at a rate of 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Since she already peeled 90 shrimp, she needs to saute 90 shrimp - 30 shrimp = <<90-30=60>>60 shrimp.  The time it takes to saute 60 shrimp is 60 / 30 = <<60/30=2>>2 minutes.  So, it takes Emily a total of 15 + 2 = <<15+2=17>>17 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.  #### 17	Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.

Unknown	Answer: Let's denote the age of Bill's father when he saw the comet as F. Then, Bill saw the comet when he was 3F years old. Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, the difference between the age of Bill and the age of his father when they saw the comet is a multiple of 75. Let's denote the difference between their ages as D. We can write the equation: 3F - F = D Solving for F, we get: 2F = D F = D/2 Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, D is a multiple of 75. Let's find the smallest possible value of D that is a multiple of 75 and makes F a reasonable age. The smallest possible value of D that is a multiple of 75 and makes F a reasonable age is 75. In this case, F = 75/2 = <<75/2=37.5>>37.5, which is not a reasonable age.

52	Answer: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month, so he writes 12 checks per year for the electric bill. He writes a check for the gas bill once per month, so he writes 12 checks per year for the gas bill. He writes a check to the church twice per month, so he writes 24 checks per year for the church. He writes a check to the pest and lawn service 4 times per year (quarterly), so he writes 4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service. To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we add the number of checks he writes for each bill: 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = <<12+12+24+4=52>>52 checks per year. #### 52	Answer: Buford writes a check for the electric bill once per month, so he writes 12 checks per year for the electric bill.~| He writes a check for the gas bill once per month, so he writes 12 checks per year for the gas bill.~| He writes a check to the church twice per month, so he writes 24 checks per year for the church.~| He writes a check to the pest and lawn service 4 times per year (quarterly), so he writes 4 checks per year for the pest and lawn service.~| To find the total number of checks Buford writes per year, we add the number of checks he writes for each bill:~| 12 (electric) + 12 (gas) + 24 (church) + 4 (pest and lawn service) = <<12+12+24+4=52>>52 checks per year.~| #### 52
33	Answer: Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as F. The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so it goes to Greece F*(3/4) times. The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so F*(1/4) flights go to France. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day, so 44 = F/2. We can set up an equation to solve for F: F*(3/4) + F*(1/4) = 44 + F/2 Solving this equation, we find that F = 132. Now, we can find the number of flights to France by multiplying the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day by the fraction of flights that go to France: F*(1/4) = 132*(1/4) = <<132*1/4=33>>33. #### 33	Answer: Let's denote the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day as F.~| The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, so it goes to Greece F*(3/4) times.~| The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so F*(1/4) flights go to France.~| The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day, so 44 = F/2.~| We can set up an equation to solve for F:~| F*(3/4) + F*(1/4) = 44 + F/2~| Solving this equation, we find that F = 132.~| Now, we can find the number of flights to France by multiplying the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day by the fraction of flights that go to France:~| F*(1/4) = 132*(1/4) = <<132*1/4=33>>33.~| #### 33

1	Answer: First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on rounds. He has 10 appointments, each lasting 30 minutes, so that takes 10 * 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes. Then, he has 9 inpatients, and it takes 20 minutes per inpatient, so that takes 9 * 20 = <<9*20=180>>180 minutes. Adding these two times together, Doctor Jones spends a total of 300 + 180 = <<300+180=480>>480 minutes on appointments and rounds. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Doctor Jones spends 480 / 60 = <<480/60=8>>8 hours on appointments and rounds. Since he spends 9 hours at the clinic, he has 9 - 8 = <<9-8=1>>1 hour left to update his records. #### 1	Answer: First, let's calculate the total time Doctor Jones spends on rounds.

224	Answer: Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, which means she sold 3 boxes and 0.5 boxes. Since each box contains 64 chocolate bars (as we know from the total number of chocolate bars they sold together), 3 boxes contain 3 * 64 = <<3*64=192>>192 chocolate bars. The remaining 0.5 boxes contain 0.5 * 64 = <<0.5*64=32>>32 chocolate bars. Since each box contains a whole number of chocolate bars, the number of chocolate bars in a box must be a multiple of 64. The smallest multiple of 64 that is greater than 192 is 224.

We have the following equations:  1) 4x = 64 (Peter's total) 2) 7y = 56 (Martha's total)  To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can solve these equations for x and y, and then subtract y from x.  From equation 1), we get x = 64 / 4 = 16. From equation 2), we get y = 56 / 7 ≈ 8.0714 (approximately).  Since we cannot have a fraction of a chocolate bar, we round y to the nearest whole number, which is 8.  Now, we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box:  x - y = 16 - 8 = <<16-8=8>>8  So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. #### 8	Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as x for Peter and y for Martha.~| ~| We have the following equations:~| ~| 1) 4x = 64 (Peter's total)~| 2) 7y = 56 (Martha's total)~| ~| To find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box, we can solve these equations for x and y, and then subtract y from x.~| ~| From equation 1), we get x = 64 / 4 = 16.~| From equation 2), we get y = 56 / 7 ≈ 8.0714 (approximately).~| ~| Since we cannot have a fraction of a chocolate bar, we round y to the nearest whole number, which is 8.~| ~| Now, we can find the difference in the number of chocolate bars in each box:~| ~| x - y = 16 - 8 = <<16-8=8>>8~| ~| So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.~| #### 8

Unknown	Let's break this down:  1. First, we need to find the charge of the power bank after 5 hours at 9% loss per hour.    Let P0 be the initial charge of the power bank.    After 5 hours, the charge would be P0 * (1 - 0.09)^5  2. Then, for the next 3 hours, the loss rate decreases to 7%.    The charge after 8 hours would be the charge after 5 hours multiplied by (1 - 0.07)^3  3. Finally, the remaining charge is 28% of the charge after 8 hours.    So, the remaining charge is 0.28 * (P0 * (1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3)  4. We can rearrange the equation to solve for P0:    P0 = (Remaining charge) / ((1 - 0.09)^5 * (1 - 0.07)^3)  5.

30	Answer: There's a 50% chance that Marcus won't have a substitute teacher, so that's 50%. If he doesn't have a substitute teacher, there's a 40% chance he'll get an extension. So, the probability of not having an extension is 1 - 40% = 60% - 40% = 20%. If he doesn't have an extension, there's a 20% chance he can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. So, the probability of not getting a personal extension is 1 - 20% = 80% - 20% = 60%. Since there's no overlap between the events, we multiply the probabilities together: 50% \* 60% = 0.5 \* 0.6 = 0.3 = 30%. So, Marcus has a 30% chance of actually having to turn in his homework tomorrow. #### 30	Answer: There's a 50% chance that Marcus won't have a substitute teacher, so that's 50%.~| If he doesn't have a substitute teacher, there's a 40% chance he'll get an extension.

2304	Answer: First, we need to find the cost of the insurance for one month when it is not 60% more than normal. This is $120. Next, we need to find the cost of the insurance for one month when it is 60% more than normal. To do this, we multiply the normal cost by 1.6 (since 100% + 60% = 160%). So, the cost for one month when it is 60% more than normal is $120 * 1.6 = $<<120*1.6=192>>192. Finally, we need to find the cost of the insurance for a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the cost for one month when it is 60% more than normal by 12. So, the cost for a year is $192 * 12 = $<<192*12=2304>>2304. #### 2304	Answer: First, we need to find the cost of the insurance for one month when it is not 60% more than normal.

58	Answer: Let B be the number of minutes it took Betsy to make her part of the meal, and D be the number of minutes it took Donovan to make his part. We know that B + D = 98, and that B > D, because Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part. Since B > D, we can write B = D + 18. Now we have two equations: 1. B + D = 98 2. B = D + 18 We can solve these equations simultaneously by substitution. Replace B in the first equation with D + 18: D + (D + 18) = 98 2D + 18 = 98 2D = 80 D = 40 Now that we have the value for D, we can find the value for B: B = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 #### 58	Answer: Let B be the number of minutes it took Betsy to make her part of the meal, and D be the number of minutes it took Donovan to make his part.~| We know that B + D = 98, and that B > D, because Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.~| Since B > D, we can write B = D + 18.~| Now we have two equations:~| 1.

Unknown	Answer:  First, let's find out how many big coupons Anthony wants to send out. Since he wants twice as many big coupons as small ones, we can say that the number of big coupons is 2 times the number of small coupons.  So, the number of big coupons is 2 \* 700 = 1400.  Now, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Since each small coupon costs 5 cents, the total cost for the small coupons is 700 \* 5 = 3500 cents.  Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Since each big coupon costs 15 cents, the total cost for the big coupons is 1400 \* 15 = 21000 cents.  Finally, let's add the costs for the small and big coupons to find the total cost of postage. The total cost is 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents.

Unknown	Answer: First, let's find out how many roses Jenny bought that were not part of a dozen. To do this, we subtract the number of roses that make up a dozen from the total number of roses she bought: 15 - 12 = <<15-12=3>>3 roses. Since Jenny bought these extra roses individually, she paid $2 for each of them: 3 * $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6. Now, let's see how much she paid for the dozen roses. Since she bought 15 roses, she must have bought at least one dozen: 12. The cost of the dozen roses is $15, so the remaining roses cost $15 - $12 = $<<15-12=3>>3. Since these remaining roses were part of a dozen, they were bought at a discounted rate of $1 per rose: 3 * $1 = $<<3*1=3>>3. Now, let's add the cost of the individual roses and the cost of the dozen roses: $	Answer: First, let's find out how many roses Jenny bought that were not part of a dozen.

Unknown	Answer: First, let's calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers during their 10-hour shift.  The 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour each produce 2 * 6 * 10 = <<2*6*10=1200>>1200 toys. The 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour each produce 2 * 4 * 10 = <<2*4*10=800>>800 toys.  So, the first 4 workers produce a total of 1200 + 800 = <<1200+800=2000>>2000 toys.  Since there are still 400 - 2000 = <<400-2000=-1600>>-1600 toys needed to be produced, the fifth worker must produce 1600 toys during their 10-hour shift.  Since we don't know the production rate of the fifth worker, we can't determine their production rate as an integer.

Since the cost of one sunflower is $0.67 cents, the number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days is $246 / $0.67 = <<246/0.6
-24	Answer: Adam buys rocks with $100, which means he can buy 100/5 = <<100/5=20>>20 rocks. He sells 60% of his inventory, which means he sells 20 * 0.6 = <<20*0.6=12>>12 rocks. The profit from selling one rock is $7 - $5 = $<<7-5=2>>2. So the profit from selling 12 rocks is 12 * 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24. Since Adam has $100 and spends $5 on each rock, he has $100 - (20 * 5) = $100 - 100 = $<<100-100=0>>0 left after buying the rocks. So the total cost of buying and selling the rocks is the cost of buying the rocks minus the profit from selling them, which is 0 - 24 = $<<0-24=-24>>-24. #### -24	Answer: Adam buys rocks with $100, which means he can buy 100/5 = <<100/5=20>>20 rocks.~| He sells 60% of his inventory, which means he sells 20 * 0.6 = <<20*0.6=12>>12 rocks.~| The profit from selling one rock is $7 - $5 = $<<7-5=2>>2.~| So the profit from selling 12 rocks is 12 * 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24.~| Since Adam has $100 and spends $5 on each rock, he has $100 - (20 * 5) = $100 - 100 = $<<100-100=0>>0 left after buying the rocks.~| So the total cost of buying and selling the rocks is the cost of buying the rocks minus the profit from selling them, which is 0 - 24 = $<<0-24=-24>>-24.~| #### -24

The 3 ropes have a combined length of 37 centimeters. This means that the sum of the lengths of the blue, yellow, and red ropes is 37. So we have the equation b + (b+7) + 4*b = 37.~| 4. Simplifying the equation, we get 6*b + 7 = 37.~| 5. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 6*b = 30.~| 6. Dividing both sides by 6, we get b = 5.~| 7. So the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters.~| 8. The length of the yellow rope is 5
Unknown	Answer: Rissa was given 3 times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa has 3*Ronnie's amount. After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. Let the amount of money Ronnie had be R. Then Rissa had 3R. The amount of money they gave to their little sister is the same, so Rissa gave Rissa's - R = (3R - R) = 2R. Now Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so 4/5 \* (3R) = Rissa's money - 2R = 2R * (4/5) = 8/5 \* R Since Rissa's money is 8/5 \* R, Ronnie's money is Rissa's money - Rissa's money given to the little sister = (8/5 \* R) - 2R = (8/5 - 2) \* R = (3/5) \* R So Ronnie's money is	Answer: Rissa was given 3 times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa has 3*Ronnie's amount.~| After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money.~| Let the amount of money Ronnie had be R.

Unknown	Answer: First, we need to find out how many pods are in the special size box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the special size box by multiplying the number of pods in the regular box by 1.2 (since 100% + 20% = 120%, or 1.2).  So, the number of pods in the special size box is 100 * 1.2 = <<100*1.2=120>>120.  Next, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 using 1 pod per cycle. Since each pod costs $12, we can divide the total number of pods in the special size box by $12 to find out how many cycles can be run.

So, we have 28 - 2*Jim = Jim, and solving for Jim, we get Jim = 14. #### 14	Answer: When Digimon came out, Jim was half as old as John.

So, we can set up the equation 2*Jim + x = 28, where x is the number of years that have passed since Digimon came out.~| Solving for x, we get x = 28 - 2*Jim. Since we want to find Jim's current age, we can set Jim's current age to x and solve for Jim.~| So, we have 28 - 2*Jim = Jim, and solving for Jim, we get Jim = 14.~| #### 14

Unknown	Answer:  1. First, let's find out how many bottles of cognac John bought. Since he bought twice as many bottles of cognac as he did bottles of scotch, he bought 10 \* 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 bottles of cognac. 2. Next, we need to find the cost of one bottle of cognac. Since it costs 50% more per bottle than scotch, we can find the cost of one bottle of cognac by multiplying the cost of one bottle of scotch by 1.5 (since 1.5 is 100% + 50%). So the cost of one bottle of cognac is $600 \* 1.5 = $<<600*1.5=900>>900. 3.

Unknown	Answer: First, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to clean one classroom: 15 minutes per classroom. Next, we need to find out how many minutes it takes to clean all the classrooms: 80 classrooms * 15 minutes per classroom = 1200 minutes. Now, we know that they work an 8 hour day, which is 8 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 480 minutes. Finally, we can find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms by dividing the number of minutes spent cleaning classrooms by the total number of minutes in a day: 1200 minutes spent cleaning / 480 minutes per day = 1200/480 = <<1200/480=2.5>>2.5 (which is not an integer), but since we are looking for a percentage, we can convert this to a percentage by multiplying by 100: 2.5 * 100 = 250%. However, since a percentage cannot be greater than 100%, we know that this answer is incorrect.

2	Answer: Let's first find out how many books the bottom shelf can hold. Since it can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, the bottom shelf can hold 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 books. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so the top shelf can hold 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 books. Since the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books each, they can hold 10+10=<<10+10=20>>20 books. Now we can add up the number of books on each shelf: 20 (bottom) + 15 (top) + 20 (middle) = 55 books. Since Elly has 110 books, she needs 110/55=<<110/55=2>>2 bookcases to hold all of them. #### 2	Answer: Let's first find out how many books the bottom shelf can hold.

18	Answer: The additional phones cost the same amount, so let's call that amount x. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the main phone costs 2x. The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones. The total cost of the phone plan is 2x + 5x = 6x. Since the total cost of the phone plan is $20, we can set up the equation 6x = $20. To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6. x = $20 / 6 = <<20/6=3.3333333333333335>>3 Since x is the cost of one additional phone, the cost of the whole phone plan is 6*x = 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18. #### 18	Answer: The additional phones cost the same amount, so let's call that amount x.~| The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, so the main phone costs 2x.~| The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones.~| The total cost of the phone plan is 2x + 5x = 6x.~| Since the total cost of the phone plan is $20, we can set up the equation 6x = $20.~| To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 6.~| x = $20 / 6 = <<20/6=3.3333333333333335>>3~| Since x is the cost of one additional phone, the cost of the whole phone plan is 6*x = 6*3 = <<6*3=18>>18.~| #### 18

Unknown	Let's denote Aaron's speed as S and Vanessa's speed as V.  1. Since Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, his speed is 2V. 2. Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, the total distance they run together is 4 miles (Vanessa's part) + (4 miles / 2) = 6 miles (total distance). 3. The time it takes Aaron to run his part of the race is 6 miles / (2V) = 3 miles / V. 4. Since Aaron completed his part in 16 minutes, the time it takes Vanessa to run her part is 16 minutes \* (V / (3 miles / V)) = 16 minutes \* (V^2 / 3) 5. We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, so we can set up the following equation: 4 miles = 6 miles \* (V / 4) 6. Solving for V, we get V = 3/2 miles. 7. Now we can find the time it takes Vanessa to run her part: 1	Let's denote Aaron's speed as S and Vanessa's speed as V.~| ~| 1.

180	Answer: Each night, the restaurant makes 6 reservations, so they make 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 meals. Each meal costs $5, so they make 12 * $5 = $<<12*5=60>>60. They also make 6 bottles of wine, each costing $5, so they make 6 * $5 = $<<6*5=30>>30. In total, they make 60 + 30 = $<<60+30=90>>90 per night.

1	Answer:  1. First, we need to find out the total profit made by the vendor. To do this, we multiply the number of watermelons by the profit percentage. So, 50 * 25% = 12.5. 2. Next, we need to find out the total cost of the watermelons after the profit has been added. We do this by adding the profit to the original cost. So, $80 + $12.5 = $92.5. 3. Finally, we need to find out the cost of each watermelon. To do this, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons. So, $92.5 / 50 = $1.85.  However, since we are asked to give the answer as an integer, we round the decimal part to the nearest whole number. So, each watermelon was sold for $1.85 ≈ $<<1>>1.  #### 1	Answer:~| ~| 1.

Unknown	Answer: John was 19 when he had James, so James is 32 - 19 = <<32-19=13>>13 + the number of years he's been alive since then. Since James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, James is 12*2 + 3 = <<12*2+3=27>>27 years old now. John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is 32 + the number of years he's been alive since then. The youngest son is 32 + (current year - 32) = current year - 10. In 3 years, the youngest son will be current year + 3 - 10 = current year + 3 - 10 = <<current year + 3 - 10=current year - 7>>current year - 7. #### current year - 7	Answer: John was 19 when he had James, so James is 32 - 19 = <<32-19=13>>13 + the number of years he's been alive since then.~| Since James is twice as old as Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years, James is 12*2 + 3 = <<12*2+3=27>>27 years old now.~| John had his youngest son when he was 32, so his youngest son is 32 + the number of years he's been alive since then.~| The youngest son is 32 + (current year - 32) = current year - 10.~| In 3 years, the youngest son will be current year + 3 - 10 = current year + 3 - 10 = <<current year + 3 - 10=current year - 7>>current year - 7.~| #### current year - 7
